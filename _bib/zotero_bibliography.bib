  abstract = {Speech synthesis evaluation involves the analytical description of useful features, sufficient to assess the performance of a speech synthesis system. Its primary focus is to determine the degree of semblance of synthetic voice to a natural or human voice. The task of evaluation is usually driven by two methods: the subjective and objective methods, which have indeed become a regular standard for evaluating voice quality, but are mostly challenged by high speech variability as well as human discernment errors. Machine learning (ML) techniques have proven to be successful in the determination and enhancement of speech quality. Hence, this contribution utilizes both supervised and unsupervised ML tools to recognize and classify speech quality classes. Data were collected from a listening test (experiment) and the speech quality assessed by domain experts for naturalness, intelligibility, comprehensibility, as well as, tone, vowel and consonant correctness. During the pre-processing stage, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) identified 4 principal components (intelligibility, naturalness, comprehensibility and tone) – accounting for 76.79\% variability in the dataset. An unsupervised visualization using self organizing map (SOM), then discovered five distinct target clusters with high densities of instances, and showed modest correlation between significant input factors. A Pattern recognition using deep neural network (DNN), produced a confusion matrix with an overall performance accuracy of 93.1\%, thus signifying an excellent classification system.},

Proper names are usually key to understanding the information contained in a document. To increase the vocabulary coverage, a huge amount of text data should be used. In this paper, we extend the previously proposed neural networks for word embedding models: word vector representation proposed by Mikolov is enriched by an additional non-linear transformation. This model allows to better take into account lexical and semantic word relationships. In the context of broadcast news transcription and in terms of recall, experimental results show a good ability of the proposed model to select new relevant proper names.},

The most critical part, an acoustic model (AM) for Polish, is built in several steps, which include: (a) an initial bootstrapping phase that utilizes existing Czech AM, (b) a lightly-supervised iterative scheme for automatic collection and annotation of Polish speech data, and finally (c) acquisition of a large amount of broadcast data in an unsupervised way. The developed system has been evaluated in the task of automatic content monitoring of major Polish TV and Radio stations. Its transcription accuracy (measured on a set of 4 complete TV news shows with total duration of 105 min) is 79,2\%. For clean studio speech, its accuracy gets over 92\%.},

Examples of such applications include “semantic” enterprise search engines, document categorizers, speech recognizers and – last but not least – conversational agents, also known as virtual assistants or “chatbots”. The latter in particular are very sought-after in the customer care domain, where the aim is to complement the live agent experience with an artificial intelligence able to help users fulfil a task. In this paper, we discuss the challenges and limitations of industrial chatbot applications, with a particular focus on the “human-in-the-loop” aspect, whereby a cooperation between human and machine takes place in mutual interest. Furthermore, we analyse how the same aspect intervenes in other industrial natural language processing applications.},

The main concept is based on application of current and innovative principles and methods oriented towards speech and language processing, automatic speech segmentation, speech recognition, statistical modeling and adaptation of acoustic and language models to a specific topic, gender and speaking style of the speaker. We have developed a working prototype of automatic transcription system for the Slovak language, mainly designed for subtitling of various types of single- or multi-channel audiovisual recordings. Preliminary results show a significant decrease in word error rate relatively from 2.40\% to 47.10\% for an individual speaker in fully automatic transcription and subtitling of Slovak parliament speech, broadcast news or TEDx talks.},

The tasks that we survey include visual attributes, image captioning, video captioning, visual question answering, visual retrieval, human-robot interaction, robotic actions, and robot navigation. We also emphasize strategies to integrate computer vision and natural language processing models as a unified theme of distributional semantics. We make an analog of distributional semantics in computer vision and natural language processing as image embedding and word embedding, respectively. We also present a unified view for the field and propose possible future directions.},
